            <img src="mine.jpg" class="img">
            <p>The Silverbloods have granted us rare access into the Silverblood Mine earlier this week and what we found was incredible.</p>
            <p> When we entered the Cidhna Mine we were expecting hard workers and boutiful harvests, and that is exactly what we found.
                Miners reported decent compensation, and a reasonable work schedule, when asked further they did say things might seem extreme
                from the outside, but they reminded everyone that they were in fact criminals and thus deserved to work a little extra in order to
                repay society. </p>

            <h1>A Murder In Markarth!</h1>
            <img src="murder.webp" class="img">
            
            <p>Shocking everyone, it seems the Forsworn Menace has managed to sneak into the city and commit a dastardly murder!</p>
            
                <p>Margret, a Nord, was out in the markets shopping at the stalls and preparing to purchase a necklace when Weylin, a Warrens
                    resident, was seen sneaking up behind her before stabbing her in the back, yelling out as he did 'The Reach belongs to the Forsworn!' </p>

                <p>Guards in the area took control of the situation swiftly, putting down the crazed Forsworn and securing the area. though
                    after initial investigation they have determined this was simply a random act of Forsworn Violence and taht no further resources
                    needed to be wasted on further investigations

            <h1>A Dragon Attack in Helgen?</h1>
            <img src="helgenruins.webp" class="img">

            <p>Sources have claimed that a Dragon, once long thought to be extinct in Tamriel and the greater world at large
                have once again made an appearence in the province of Skyrim and have destroyed the small town of Helgen earlier
                this week.</p>

                <p>According to surviving Imperial Guards, the attack occurred shortly before the executuion of Ulfric Stormcloak,
                Jarl of Windhelm and leader of the rebellious faction known as The Stormcloaks. While the Imperial remnants insist
                that the Dragon was summoned by Ulfric, who is known to have the power of the Thuum, Stormcloak sources deny any
                such capacity of their military or leader, and that investigations are underway to determine the dragon's origins and 
                possible motivations.</p>

                <p>Jarl Balgruf has put out a statement expressing sorrow for the loss of the city, however when asked about sending aid
                or supplies for rebuilding the community, he was unable to commit to any aid until the civil war had resolved itself.</p>

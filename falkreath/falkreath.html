            <p>Residents report a shaggy dog has been sighted wandering around the dark forests surrounding Falkreath Hold.</p>
            <p>While there has been no signs of agression from the hound, caution should be taken and attempts should be made to not
                agitate the hound, including staying away from it should one encounter it during any trips outside the walls.</p>

            <h1>A New Jarl Takes Control</h1>
            <img src="jarl.jpg" class="img">
            
            <p>Jarl Siddgeir, nephew of the former Jarl, Dengeir, has taken over the duties of running Falkreath Hold.
                Citing the former Jarls advancing age, the new Jarl states it is for the good of the hold that someone with
                youth and vigor take over and assume the duties of running the hold around us. </p>
            
                <p>The New Jarl is not without controversy, as connections have been made between Siddgeir and a local group of bandits
                that have been a menace to traders travelling between the Holds, a connection Siddgeir denys vehemently, and says
                will go to great lengths to prove otherwise. </p>

                <p>When asked about opinions regarding the sides to be taken in the civil war currently scourging Skyrim, Siddgeir
                affirmed support in the Empire against the Stormcloaks who 'Do not understand the price of freedom from Imperial Rule'</p>

                <p>It is not certain how well the new Jarl will do at his job, however advisors to the Jarl have reaffirmed that they will 
                attempt to curb any of the Jarls inexperienced tendencies.</p>

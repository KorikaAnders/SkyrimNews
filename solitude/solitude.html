               <p>Ulfric, the muderous rebellion leader that killed the former high king of Skyrim with dishonerable use of the Voice, continues to walk free in Windhelm, but work is being done every day to push for
                a united Skyrim. Thalmor continue to offer magnanimous support to our cause, and assure us their complete support in ending the rebellion and rebuilding Skyrim to it's former glory.

            <p>Dragon Bridge resident Varnius Junius has arrived to Solitude intent on asking Jarl Elsif to investigate the strange disappearances occuring near Wolfskull Cave</p>
            
                <p>The Cave, located to the south, has been noted to be the home to many bandits, but recently unconfirmed reports of Necromancers have been cropping up in the area.</p>

                <p>Jarl Elsif for her part initially commanded an entire legion to scour the area, however upon the advice of her council Sybille, reduced the amount to a few more troops and a specialized scout
                    to go through the caves and investigate the area.

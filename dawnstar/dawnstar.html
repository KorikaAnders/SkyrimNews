            <img src="dawn.webp" class="img">
            <p>A new Museum has entered town. One with a surprising focus, the Mythic Dawn Cult</p>

                <p>Those with a mind for History may remember the Mythic Dawn Cult to be the cult that initiated the Oblivion Crisis 200 years prior, where the gates
                    to the plane of Oblivion opened up across tamriel, ushering in an invasion closing in the invasion of the White Gold Tower and the death of the Septim Dynasty
                </p>

                <p>When asked what brought him to opening up the Museum, Silus Vesuius revealed that his ancestors were in fact part of the Cult. "I have a collection
                    of artifacts from the group that toppled an Empire, their importance to history cannot be forgotten!"
                </p>

                <p>collection includes items such as pieces of the Mysterium Xarxes, and a complete set of the Mythic Dawn Commentaries</p>

            <p>Have you been experiencing Nightmares instead of restful dreams?</p>

            <p>You may not be alone! It seems the entire town has a plague of Nightmares and there is no end in sight. Priests of Mara have
                arrived in the town to investigate however they have repeatedly assured everyone that there is nothing to worry about and this is
                simply a strange oddity with nothing to fear.</p>

            <p>"We are doing what we can to end these nightmares. In the meantime all we ask is that you remain strong and put your trust in Lady Mara</p>

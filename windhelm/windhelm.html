            <p>Glad Tidings as Ulfric Stormcloak escapes the headsman in Helgen</p>

                <p>The War Continues apace this week, with Ulfrics Escape from Helgen. Reports have been confirmed by survivors that a Dragon did indeed
                    appear and raid the city, though noone can ascertain why the dragon began it's assault in the first place. Ulfric is beefing up patrols
                in the area and is confident that his mastery of the voice will deter any attacks upon Windhelm</p>

               <p>No new claimants have been made though Ulfric is being said to be preparing for many major attacks and even has a bead on the location of the Jagged Crown.
                More updates will follow throughout the week as events unfold.

            <p>The Butcher has claimed another victim in Susanna, famed barmaid of Candlehearth Hall.</p>
            
                <p>Found by the guards in the graveyard, the body was slashed repeatedly. Witness Calixto Corrium claimed that he saw 'a fellow running away' but didn't
                    get a good look at him'. No other witnesses were found.</p>

                <p>This is, of course, the fourth killing in as many weeks and citizens are wondering what will be done and when the streets of Windhelm will be safe once again
                    Gaurds say they're trying their best but the war has simply stretched their resources too thin. Any assistance in resolving this matter will be accepted and compensated for
